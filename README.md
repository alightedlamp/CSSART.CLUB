# CSS ART CLUB

This is a showcase of 'CSS Paintings' which were made with HTML and Sass, then ported over to React for this gallery. The paintings are sublty interactive, in that they don't animate unless the user ineracts with them directly like they would a piece of UI on a functional website. This project is a fun way to blend my interest in painting with that of user-interface ineteraction and animation.

## Built with:

- Sass
- React

## Future Development:

In addition to adding more paintings in the future, I hope to abstract away some of the HTML into React components and introduce an animation library so speed the development and reduce the tediousness of developing these from scratch.
